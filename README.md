# React-youtube-viewer

React app that cooperates with youtube API and allows
to browse it's video.

The app is very simple and was made for the sake of learning React.

Many thanks to  [Stephen Grinder](https://github.com/StephenGrider/)?, who developed a great, detailed and easy-to-follow Modern React with Redux course! (This project was coded along during the course)
